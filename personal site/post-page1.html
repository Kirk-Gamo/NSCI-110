        <h2 class="sub-heading">Nature of Science</h2>
        <p class="post-text">In delving into the nature of science, I discovered that it is not merely a collection of facts or a static body of knowledge. Rather, science is a dynamic process—a continuous quest for understanding the natural world. Through systematic observation, experimentation, and the formulation of hypotheses, scientists unravel the mysteries of the universe.</p>
        <p class="post-text"> I learned that scientific theories are not absolute truths but rather our best explanations based on available evidence. This realization has fostered a sense of curiosity and humility, encouraging me to embrace uncertainty and appreciate the ever-evolving nature of scientific knowledge.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Nature of Technology</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Technology shapes our lives in profound ways, from the invention of the wheel to the advent of artificial intelligence. Studying the nature of technology revealed its dual role: as an enabler of progress and as a potential disruptor. I learned that technological innovations are driven by human needs, desires, and creativity. </p>
        <p class="post-text">However, with great power comes great responsibility. Reflecting on the ethical implications of technology, I realized that its development must be guided by considerations of equity, sustainability, and social impact. As I navigate the digital age, I am more conscious of the choices I make as a consumer, creator, and steward of technology.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Nature of Mathematics</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Mathematics, often regarded as the language of science, transcends cultural boundaries and provides a universal framework for understanding the world. In this unit, I explored the abstract beauty of mathematical concepts—algebraic equations, geometric proofs, and statistical models. Beyond its theoretical elegance, mathematics serves as a powerful tool for analyzing data, predicting outcomes, and solving real-world problems.</p>
        <p class="post-text"> I recognize that mathematical literacy is essential for informed decision-making, whether in scientific research, technological innovation, or everyday life. As I grapple with mathematical concepts, I am reminded that mathematics is not an isolated discipline but an integral part of the scientific endeavor.</p>
