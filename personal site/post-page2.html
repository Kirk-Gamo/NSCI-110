        <h2 class="sub-heading">Interconnectedness of Science, Technology, and Society</h2>
        <p class="post-text">The intricate web connecting science, technology, and society became evident during this unit. Scientific discoveries fuel technological advancements, which, in turn, shape societal norms and behaviors. I reflected on how breakthroughs in medicine, communication, and energy production ripple through our lives, affecting everything from healthcare accessibility to environmental conservation.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Recognizing this interconnectedness inspires me to engage in interdisciplinary dialogue and collaborate across fields. As I ponder the delicate balance between progress and unintended consequences, I am reminded that no domain exists in isolation—we are all part of a complex ecosystem.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Ethical Considerations in regards to Science and Technology</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Ethics permeate every facet of science and technology. Whether it’s genetic engineering, data privacy, or climate change mitigation, ethical choices underpin our actions. I grappled with questions about the responsible use of scientific knowledge and the potential harm caused by unchecked technological development. </p>
        <p class="post-text">The precautionary principle—acting with caution when faced with uncertain risks—became a guiding compass. I now approach technological innovations with a critical eye, considering their impact on marginalized communities, the environment, and future generations. These reflections reinforce the importance of ethical literacy alongside scientific and technical expertise.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Personal Impact of Science and Technology</h2>
        <p class="post-text">As a participant in this grand narrative of science, technology, and society, I recognize my agency. My choices—whether as a student, a consumer, or a global citizen—contribute to the collective trajectory. I reflected on my role in promoting scientific literacy, advocating for responsible innovation, and fostering a culture of curiosity. By embracing lifelong learning and engaging with diverse perspectives, I hope to be an informed and conscientious actor in this ever-evolving saga.</p>
        <p class="post-text"> This unit reminded me that knowledge is not passive; it demands action and reflection. As I embark on this journey, I carry with me the conviction that understanding the interplay of science, technology, and society empowers us to shape a better future.</p>
